# Zombie_Cow
DPR final project
App is based on a travel game played with my children.  They would count the cows on their side of the road, if you passed a grave 
yard your cows died, who ever had the most cows at the end won.
  I added a random Zombie cow event - if your cows died you could generate zombie cows that would kill off an equal number of the other
  players cows 
  swipe the cow right and left to add to the cow count - if you pass a grave yard click the grave yard on the correct side of the screen
  there is a 200 cow limit per entry
